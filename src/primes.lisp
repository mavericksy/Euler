  ;;
  ;; We want to avoid bignums as much as possible.  This computes (base^exp % m)

  ;; that:
  ;;
  ;;     (x * y) % m

  ;;
  ;; So for the cases where `exp` is even, we can split base^exp into an x and
  ;; y both equal to base^(exp/2) and use the above trick to handle them
  ;; separately.  Even better, we can just compute it once and square it.
